                        <p>Hey folks! My name is Marcin, I am the CEO at Coding Buzz - a software company of my own. Welcome to my website!</p>
                        <p>I was born in 1991 in Bełchatów, Poland. I knew that my career would be connected with IT since I was 9 years old. Then I got my first computer and went crazy on its point.</p>
                        <p>My first serious coding classes took place when I was 13. I started with HTML and Pascal, later on I went for C++ and JavaScript, finishing on Java, Python and Ruby. In the meantime I started dealing with algorithm contests and web application development.</p>
                        <p>In my professional career I have always been trying to be self-sufficient. Today, after graduating from Technical University of Łódź and with few years of work experience I am a full stack software developer.</p>
                        <p>During work I often experience something what I call "The Coding Buzz". It's a state when I have a problem to solve, a keyboard right underneath my fingers, screen in front of my eyes and music in my ears. Nothing else matters.</p>
                        <p>This is the genesis of my company's name. It's also a guarantee that I work on every project with the utmost care. Why? Because I love to feel the Buzz.</p>
